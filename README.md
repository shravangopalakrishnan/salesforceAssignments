**API ASSIGNMENTS:**


**QUESTION 1:**

When a contact is created/deleted, make a callout to third party system https://demo.com and send the contactId.

**Files to check:** ContactTrigger, ContactCalloutService, ContactCalloutServiceTest, MockHttpResponse

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**QUESTION 2:**

Connect two Salesforce Orgs, say Org_A and Org_B, in such a way that, whenever a Lead is created, a copy of it should be created in Org_B and when a Lead is updated/ deleted in Org_A, same action must be performed on the corresponding Lead in Org_B.

**Files to check:** LeadSyncTrigger, LeadSyncHandler, LeadSyncService

LeadSyncTrigger triggers the appropriate methods in LeadSyncHandler when a Lead is inserted/updated/deleted in Org A(Source Org). LeadSyncService is the REST Resource in Org B(Target Org) that handles callouts from Org A in order to sync the operations in Leads on Org B.

**QUESTION 3:**

Write a custom REST API that returns the count of contacts, opportunities, cases associated with an account. 
AccountID will be passed as input

**Files to check:** AccountSummaryAPI

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**QUESTION 4:**

Task-1 

Sync two salesforce orgs and perform insertion and update on Contact Object using Named Credentials and auth Provider (without using Triggers). 

**Files to check:** Folder API-Q5/Task1: ContactSyncService, ContactSyncScheduler, ContactSyncRestResource, ContactSyncServiceTest

ContactSyncService class handles the syncing of contacts between Source Org and target Org. When a new contact is created or an existing contact is updated in Org A, the contacts in Org B will be synced accordingly.
Sync happens with the help of the Scheduler class (ContactSyncScheduler) that schedules the sync for every one hour.


Task-2 

Set up SSO in org and authenticate the salesforce login page through SSO. 

On login page, Create a SSO login + Plus username/password flow. 

**Files to check:** Login Page of Target Org - Users would find an option to login with Identity Provider (Source Org).


Task-3 

Using SOAP API, check for insert, update and delete for account object in an org. 

**Files to check:** Tools such as Postman can be used to make SOAP API callouts to the Account object in the org.


Task-4 

Create a Case submission form with google reCAPTCHA and case should be created in salesforce. 

**Files to check:** Visualforces Page - caseSubmissionForm in the Org


Task-5 

Call Future method from batch class (Using Integration). 

**Files to check:** API-Q5/Task5 Folder: AccountBatch, AccountFutureService, AccountQueueableService, BatchExecutor, AccountBatchTest

Since Future classes cannot be called directly by Batch classes as it is not possible to call an asynchronous class from another asynchronous class, I have used the help of a Queueable class as a liaison between the batch class and future class. The Batch Executor runs the Batch class, which invokes the schedulable class, which in turn calls the future class to create new records.
